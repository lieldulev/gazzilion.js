# Gazzilion.js

[Gazzilion.js](http://lieldulev.github.com/gazzilion.js/ "Gazzilion.js") tries to solve the common problem of displaying the pretty or textual version for numbers.

**Important**: Since development is in early stages **expect API to break**.

## What

It takes numbers in javascript like 21013 and converts them to human readable strings for display like: 

* 21,013 
* 21K
* 21 thousand

## Works everywhere

Old node.js, new node.js and all browsers.

## Planned

* Multilingual support
* Configuration
* More "complex" formats  - currency, date/time, units (metric/imperial) .

## API

    Gazzilion.add_commas(21013); // "21,013"
    Gazzilion.M(315098123); // "315M"
    my_number = 8135432967;
    my_number.to_word(); // "8 billion"

Full API is available in [here](http://lieldulev.github.com/gazzilion.js/ "Gazzilion.js").
